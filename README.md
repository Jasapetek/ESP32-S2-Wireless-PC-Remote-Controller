‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** This project emulates a USB HID device. Only use it on computers you own or have permission to control. Misuse can cause serious issues.

## Overview

This project allows you to control your PC remotely using your phone via WiFi. The ESP32-S2 acts as a wireless USB HID device, providing seamless computer control through a modern web interface.

### Features

- **Mouse and keyboard control** - Full cursor movement, clicks, and text input
- **Shortcut commands** - Run dialog, Task Manager, Show Desktop
- **Power controls** - Shutdown, Restart, Lock Computer, Sleep, Wake-up (BETA)
- **Modern web interface** - Clean, mobile-optimized UI with dark/light mode toggle
- **Fast performance** - Instant boot (~10 seconds) and ~50ms input delay
- **USB-stick form factor** - ESP32-S2 with Type-A connector for plug-and-play convenience

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** Some advanced features such as wake computer from sleep are still in development (BETA) and may not work reliably on all systems.

## What You Need

### Hardware
- ESP32-S2 board with native USB support (can be built into a USB-stick form factor)
- USB cable (for programming and optional power)

### Software
- [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) (latest version recommended)
- ESP32 Board Support in Arduino IDE
- Required libraries (install via Library Manager)

## Board Settings in Arduino IDE

1. Go to **Tools > Board > ESP32S2 Dev Module** (or your ESP32-S2 variant)
2. **USB CDC On Boot:** Enabled
3. **Upload Mode:** Internal USB (if available)

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** Ensure your board has native USB support. HID functionality will not work on boards without it.

## Installation & Upload

1. Open the `.ino` file in Arduino IDE
2. **IMPORTANT:** Change the default WiFi credentials in the code before uploading:
3. Install any missing libraries via Library Manager
4. Connect your ESP32-S2 via USB (or use the built-in Type-A connector if your board allows)
5. Press **Upload** in Arduino IDE
6. Wait a few seconds for the ESP32-S2 to boot and create its WiFi network

## Using the Remote Controller

1. **Connect to WiFi:** Connect your phone to the ESP32-S2 WiFi network using your custom credentials
2. **Open Web Interface:** Navigate to the displayed IP address in your browser (`http://192.168.4.1`)
3. **Control Your PC:** Use the modern UI with the following features:

### Power Controls
- üî¥ **Shutdown** - Safely shutdown your computer
- üîÑ **Restart** - Restart your computer
- üîí **Lock Computer** - Lock your Windows session
- üò¥ **Sleep** - Put your computer to sleep mode
- ‚ö° **Wake Up (BETA)** - Attempt to wake computer from sleep

### Additional Features
- **Mouse Control** - Touchpad-style movement and clicks (left, right, double-click, scroll)
- **Keyboard Input** - Type text directly or use common shortcuts (Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V, Alt+Tab)
- **System Actions** - Quick access to Task Manager, Run Dialog, Show Desktop
- **Theme Toggle** - Switch between dark and light mode (located in header)

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** Wake-up functionality is experimental and may not work on all PCs. Screenshot functionality has been temporarily removed and will be re-added in future updates.

## WiFi Network Configuration

### Default Credentials (‚ö†Ô∏è CHANGE THESE!)
- **Default SSID:** `WirelessRemote-ESP32`
- **Default Password:** `RemoteControl123`

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Warning
**You MUST change the default WiFi credentials before deploying this project!** The default credentials are publicly known and pose a security risk.

### How to Change Credentials
1. Open the Arduino code (`.ino` file)
2. Find these lines at the top:
   ```cpp
   // WiFi credentials for Access Point mode
   const char* ssid = "WirelessRemote-ESP32";     // Change this!
   const char* password = "RemoteControl123";     // Change this password!
   ```
3. Replace with your own secure network name and password:
   ```cpp
   // WiFi credentials for Access Point mode
   const char* ssid = "YourCustomNetworkName";
   const char* password = "YourSecurePassword123";
   ```
4. Save and upload the modified code to your ESP32-S2

### Password Requirements
- **Minimum 8 characters** (WPA2 requirement)
- **Use a strong, unique password** - avoid common words or patterns
- **Don't use the same password** as your main WiFi network

## Safety & Usage Tips

- **Security First:** Do not plug into untrusted computers. HID devices can send commands without user confirmation.
- **Change Default Credentials:** Never use the default WiFi credentials in production
- **Confirmation Dialogs:** All power controls (shutdown, restart, sleep) include confirmation prompts to prevent accidental execution.
- **Physical Protection:** If using USB-stick form factor, protect the exposed Type-A connector when not in use to prevent damage.
- **Network Security:** The WiFi access point is open to anyone who knows the credentials

## Troubleshooting

- **HID Not Working:** Ensure your ESP32-S2 board supports native USB HID
- **Can't Connect to WiFi:** Verify you changed the credentials in the code and uploaded successfully
- **Commands Not Responding:** Verify the device is enabled via the Toggle Device button
- **Upload Failures:** Make sure "USB CDC On Boot" is enabled in Arduino IDE settings
